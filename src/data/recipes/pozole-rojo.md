- Prepare the [hominy](./hominy.md)


- Ended up doing maybe half a pork shoulder (the part that was left on the bone)
- Cooked for 1:15 and then left it for about 5 hours after just because we were busy and it came out great.
- Pork broth had a handful of bay leaves, half yellow onion and garlic cloves
- Covered the shoulder with water to about a fingernails depth on top of shoulder
- Salted liberally
- Once finished, strained the broth through a fine mesh Colander
- Shredded the pork and removed the fat and weird dark pieces and non good looking meat
- Hominy was made much earlier in the day, ended up doing close to 600grams of hominy, basically a 32oz container of hominy more or less which was the right amount.
- 1% cal to the weight of dried corn
- Brought to a simmer and then left for about an hour or so
- Drained and thoroughly rinsed/cleaned the corn, it took a while before I could agitate the corn in water and the water run would clear, took a bit.
- Once done, cooked the hominy in instant pot without salt for about 1 hour 15 min as well. Drained and rinsed hominy once finished stored in fridge until it was ready to integrate with pork broth
- Once I had clean pork broth, I put the shredded pork and hominy back together, took some of the broth and used it to steep about 10 or so guajillos and about 4 anchos
- Blended that with 3 clove of garlic and about a third of a half a white onion fresh
- Ended up adding 1 tsp of chicken bouillon to the pepper water and a cup of water to thin it out.
- Strained the blend into the final pot. Let it come to a boil for a bit and then it was about done.

Final Notes:

- could've cooked the hominy a bit more
- I wouldn't have minded a bit more broth in the final product, it's always a bit light on broth.
